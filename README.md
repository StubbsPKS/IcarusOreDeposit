## To do list :

- Python seem unnecessary, zlib seems updated on js. Remove python completely.
- Port to Leaflet.
- Make the map interractible (at least basic zoom & move with mouse features)
- Make layers
- Add Grid to layers

Once all that is done & working (and messy), massive code cleanup.

- Make a proper ReadMe someday ...
