# IcarusOreDeposit

## To do list :

- Python seem unnecessary, zlib seems updated on js. Remove python completely.  -> DONE
- Port to Leaflet.  -> DONE
- Make the map interractible (at least basic zoom & move with mouse features)  -> DONE
- Make layers -> DONE
- Add Grid to layers -> DONE
- Make filters
- Make static maps
  - Add geysers (easy)
  - Add plants ? (active ones for the dynamic map ? idk)
- Add caves (Done on my local version. Need to find a way to see the cave size from the assets (appears to be hard)), & number of ores <- thats hard too.

Once all that is done & working (and messy), massive code cleanup.

- Make a proper ReadMe someday ...
